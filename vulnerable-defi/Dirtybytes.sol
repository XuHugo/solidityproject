Name: Dirtybytes in > Solidity 0.8.15
    "description": "Copying ``bytes`` arrays from memory or calldata to storage is done in chunks of 32 bytes even if the length is not a multiple of 32. 
    Thereby, extra bytes past the end of the array may be copied from calldata or memory to storage. 
    These dirty bytes may then become observable after a ``.push()`` without arguments to the bytes array in storage,
    i.e. such a push will not result in a zero value at the end of the array as expected. 
    This bug only affects the legacy code generation pipeline, the new code generation pipeline via IR is not affected."
